Iteration source code:
By Kathleen Tuite

This is a pretty simple iphone application. It draws pictures by plotting thousands of little points and then has the ability to save these pictures. There are also adjustable settings in a different 'view'. 

I have no idea how to get this code to compile on my computer anymore. Maybe I never downloaded the iPhone SDK on my newish computer? There are some Frameworks that were being used in a previous version but are now red and angry, and I'll list those just in case:

CoreGraphics
QuartzCore
OpenGLES
UIKit
Foundation
CoreGraphics
